## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open terminal in the project directory
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production (with Offline Support)

To create a production build with full offline functionality:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will include:

- Service worker for caching
- PWA manifest for mobile installation
- Optimized assets for offline use

## 📱 PWA Features

### Installation

- **Desktop**: Look for the install prompt in your browser
- **Mobile**: Add to home screen from browser menu
- **Chrome**: Click the install icon in the address bar

### Offline Usage

1. Visit the app once while online (to cache content)
2. Disconnect from the internet
3. The app will continue to work with all features
4. An offline indicator will show when you're disconnected

## 🔧 Offline Implementation Details

### Service Worker Strategy

- **Cache First**: Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- **Network First**: HTML pages and API calls
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Dynamic content

### Caching Strategy

- **App Shell**: Core app structure cached immediately
- **Content**: All interview questions cached on first visit
- **Images**: Cached with expiration (30 days)
- **API**: Network first with 5-minute cache

### Offline Detection

- Real-time network status monitoring
- Visual indicator when offline
- Automatic reconnection handling

## 🎯 Customization

You can easily add new questions by modifying the data files:

- `src/data/interviewData.js` - Main questions
- `src/data/systemDesignData.js` - System design questions

Each question supports different types:

- `comparison-table`: For comparing features/concepts
- `text-with-code`: Description with code example
- `text-with-list`: Description with bullet points
- `list-only`: Simple bullet point list
- `code-only`: Just code implementation

## 🌐 Deployment

### Static Hosting (Recommended)

- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `build` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository
- **GitHub Pages**: Use `gh-pages` package
- **Firebase Hosting**: Use Firebase CLI

### Server Requirements

- Any static file server
- HTTPS required for service worker
- No server-side rendering needed

## 📊 Performance

### Bundle Size

- Optimized with code splitting
- Lazy loading for components
- Compressed assets

### Loading Speed

- First load: ~2-3 seconds
- Subsequent loads: ~1 second
- Offline access: Instant

## 🔒 Security

- HTTPS required for PWA features
- No sensitive data stored
- All content is static and safe

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Offline Not Working?

1. Ensure you're using HTTPS in production
2. Check browser console for service worker errors
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Verify manifest.json is accessible

### Installation Issues?

1. Check if your browser supports PWA
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check browser's site settings

## 📈 Analytics & Monitoring

The app includes basic offline analytics:

- Service worker registration status
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Offline usage tracking
