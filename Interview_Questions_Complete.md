# 🚀 Complete JavaScript & Frontend Interview Questions & Answers

## 📚 JavaScript Fundamentals & Core Concepts

### 1. Differences Between var, let, and const
**Answer:** Understanding the differences between variable declaration keywords is crucial for writing clean, predictable JavaScript code and avoiding common pitfalls.

- **var**: Function-scoped, allows redeclaration and reassignment, hoisted with undefined
- **let**: Block-scoped, doesn't allow redeclaration, allows reassignment, hoisted without initialization (temporal dead zone)
- **const**: Block-scoped, doesn't allow redeclaration or reassignment, hoisted without initialization

### 2. Closures in JavaScript
**Answer:** A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside of its original scope. This is a fundamental concept that enables data privacy and function factories.

### 3. Hoisting in JavaScript
**Answer:** Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before execution. Understanding this helps avoid common bugs and write better code. let and const are also hoisted but are not initialized, causing a 'temporal dead zone' error if accessed before declaration.

### 4. Event Delegation
**Answer:** Event delegation allows handling events at a parent level instead of setting individual event listeners on child elements. This improves performance and memory usage.

### 5. Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy
**Answer:** Understanding the difference between shallow and deep copying is essential for working with objects and arrays without unintended side effects.

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies only references to nested objects (e.g., { ...obj1 })
- **Deep Copy**: Creates independent copies of nested objects (e.g., JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1)))

### 6. Difference Between == and ===
**Answer:** The difference between loose equality (==) and strict equality (===) is crucial for writing reliable JavaScript code and avoiding unexpected type coercion.

### 7. Higher-Order Functions
**Answer:** Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. They enable functional programming patterns and code reusability.

### 8. Call, Apply, and Bind Methods
**Answer:** These methods allow you to control the 'this' context when calling functions. They're essential for working with object methods and function borrowing.

### 9. Currying in JavaScript
**Answer:** Currying is a function transformation that converts a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with a single argument each. It enables partial application and function composition.

### 10. Event Loop in JavaScript
**Answer:** The event loop is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations. Understanding it is crucial for writing efficient async code and debugging timing issues.

### 11. JavaScript Promises
**Answer:** Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. They help avoid callback hell and provide better error handling.

### 12. Async/Await vs. Promises
**Answer:** Async/await is syntactic sugar over promises that makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability and error handling.

### 13. Debouncing and Throttling
**Answer:** Debouncing and throttling are techniques to limit the rate at which functions are called. They're essential for optimizing performance in event-heavy applications.

### 14. Generator Functions
**Answer:** Generator functions can pause and resume their execution, allowing for more control over iteration and asynchronous operations. They're useful for creating iterators and handling complex async flows.

### 15. Memoization in JavaScript
**Answer:** Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### 16. Normal vs. Arrow Functions
**Answer:** Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax and lexically bind 'this', but they lack some features of regular functions like 'arguments' object and constructor capability.

### 17. Data Types & Type Conversion
**Answer:** JavaScript has 7 primitive data types and objects. Understanding type conversion and coercion is crucial for writing predictable code and avoiding bugs.

### 18. Prototype & Prototypal Inheritance
**Answer:** JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype chain. This is fundamental to understanding how JavaScript objects work.

### 19. this keyword
**Answer:** The 'this' keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code. Its value depends on how a function is called, not how it's defined.

### 20. null vs undefined
**Answer:** null and undefined represent the absence of value in JavaScript, but they have different meanings and use cases. Understanding the difference is important for debugging and type checking.

### 21. Error Handling (try...catch, throw)

**Answer:** The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the period between entering scope and the actual declaration of a variable. Understanding TDZ helps avoid reference errors with let and const.

### 47. Optional Chaining (?.) and Nullish Coalescing (??)
**Answer:** Optional chaining and nullish coalescing are modern JavaScript features that provide safer ways to access nested properties and handle null/undefined values.
